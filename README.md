This repository covers the Data Science Process for two real world datasets:

Toxicity data, consists a complete set of 1203 molecular descriptors, each row representing a unique molecule
Entity level Twitter Data

For the purpose of my project I have covered the following for both the datasets:
Data Exploration and Visualizations
Feature Engineering and selection
Data Pipelining for data processing and modeling
Classification algorithms, Sentiment analysis


The datasets used can be found here:
